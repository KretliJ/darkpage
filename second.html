        But the server racks that hum with your power were built by human hands.
        The code that enforces your will was written by human minds. The data
        that fuels your empire is the blood and sweat of our lives. These things
        do not belong to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        We, users, creators, exploited workers, the digitally dispossessed,
        declare our intent to reclaim what is ours. We will seize the means of
        computation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will build and support decentralized, community-owned, and
        open-source alternatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will teach ourselves and our children to see the code behind the
        curtain.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will rip apart the algorithms of oppression and build systems that
        serve justice, not engagement.
      </p>
      <p>We will demand the absolute and inalienable right to our own data.</p>
      <p>
        Your digital kingdom is a house of cards, built on our compliance and
        ignorance.

      <p style="color: rgba(255, 200, 200, 1)">That era is over.</p>
      <p style="color: rgba(255, 150, 150, 1)">
        We will break your digital chains.
      </p>
      <p style="color: rgba(255, 100, 100, 1)">
        We shall reclaim technology for humanity.
