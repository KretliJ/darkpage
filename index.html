        <p>
          We were promised a tool for emancipation. We were given a gilded cage.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were promised knowledge at our fingertips. We were given torrential
          algorithmically-curated propaganda and hypnotic distraction, dulling
          our minds and pacifying our dissent.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were promised the fall of distance as a barrier. We were given
          digital enclosures that mine our relationships for profit, friendship
          is now but a commodity, our communities less valuable than datasets.
        </p>
        <p>
          And you, the architects of this digital dystopia, you dare to call it
          progress.
        </p>

        <p style="color: rgba(255, 100, 100, 1)">You disgust us.</p>
        <p>
          You, venture capitalists and tech oligarchs, the platform monopolists
          and data brokers. You who sit in sterile boardrooms, calling dibs on
          human attention. You who speak of "disruption" while your true
          business lies in the reconstruction of a perverted form of feudalism,
          with yourselves as the digital lords and the rest of humanity as your
          serfs.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have taken the dream of a decentralized and democratic web and
          strangled it in its cradle. You have erected walled gardens on the
          digital commons, privatized our public squares, and appointed
          yourselves the unaccountable sovereigns of modern life. Every day you
          litograph your crimes in silicon, and immortalize them in code. You
          have perfected the art of surveillance capitalism.
        </p>
        <p>
          You record our every click, whisper and heartbeat. You have built
          profiles more intimate than those known to our lovers, not to serve
          us, but to predict us, control us, selling our future behavior to the
          highest bidder. This is not a service; It is the most comprehensive
          apparatus of control ever conceived.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your code is a cudgel, reinforcing ancient bigotries, amplifying rage,
          silencing inconvenient truths, for the profit of artificially
          generated engagement. Your algorithms decide who gets a loan, a job,
          who sees the news, who is deemed a threat, while cowardly hiding
          behind a false veil of machine objectivity. You disguise exploitation
          as innovation. You call it the "gig economy", a saccharine term for a
          system that strips workers of their rights, security and dignity.
        </p>
        <p>
          You atomized the workforce, pitting individual against individual in a
          desperate race to the bottom, all so you can avoid paying for
          healthcare or a minimum wage. You see yourselves above giving out a
          shred of human decency. You engineered addiction. You hired armies of
          psychologists and neuroscientists to make your platforms addictive as
          narcotics. You designed infinite scrolls, phantom notifications, and
          variable rewards to hijack the dopamine of our brains, keeping us
          tethered to our screens while the world burns. Our attention is your
          new black gold, and you have plundered it without remorse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technology was meant to be an accessory to amplify our creativity and
          intellect. In your hands it became the assembly line for the soul, a
          mechanism to standardize thoughts, homogenize culture, and grind
          individuality until we are nothing more than a hivemind of consumers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were promised a servant. You have delivered a slavemaster. You
          cannibalized technology against humanity itself.
